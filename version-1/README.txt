Cryptar is not finished, although much of its core functionality
works. There's still a lot of duct tape holding it together. Soon it
will be ready for real people to use without needing to run a debugger
from time to time.

This README is directed principally at folks who might help with
coding.

See the file README.code.txt for a brief overview of the code to help
you get started. It explains how the code is organized and what the
most urgent needs are. Most of the tasks are very manageable
chunks. Take a look at this file if you are interested in helping make
cryptar a stable and mature free program.
