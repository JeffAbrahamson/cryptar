    if new:
        insert into files
        insert into instances
        for each block at positions 0, 512, 1024, etc. (512 * n):
            compute checksum, sha256
            comopress, encrypt, send block
            insert into instance block
            insert into blocks
        wait for confirmation
        update instance

    if exists:
        select from files
        insert into instances
        select all from blocks where file id (make hash on rolling checksum)
        compute rolling checksum (@ 0, 1, 2, ...):
            if rolling checksum present in hash:
                compute sha1
                if sha1 matches:
                    remember local start, end, block number
        compute cover, adding blocks as needed
        for block in cover:
            insert into instanceBlocks
            if not exists:

        update instance


Restore:

    select from Files
    select from Instance where file (max or date)
    select Instance Blocks where Instance
    if not local file exists:
        fetch all blocks
        reassemble
        mv in place
    else:
        select blocks from Instance Blocks
        hash on checksum
        compute rolling checksum of file
        on hit, compute sha256
        on hit, note block
        fetch missing blocks from remote
        assemble file
        mv in place
