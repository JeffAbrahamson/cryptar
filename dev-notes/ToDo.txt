Test to stage a block and retrieve it.
Test to stage a file and its head block, then retrieve it.

Block class.
   Knows how to serialise, augment, compress, encrypt.
   Knows how to decrypt, decompress, deaugment, and unserialise.
   Knows how to confirm that its data is valid on deserialisation.
   Knows how to write itself to some unique name for transfer.

Given a candidate covering, compute a full covering.
   Covering is block id's, file offsets, checksums(x2)
   Reuse what blocks we can, add new blocks
