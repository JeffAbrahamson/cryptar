Fix all regtests to work with new Config's !!

Root can fetch and persist root.
Deleting ACT's in completion_action() may be a race condition on futures.
Config's should generally be shared_ptr<Config>.
Fix unique_string()

Back to end-to-end db test.
Will want synchronous get and put functions using promises and futures.

Use unique_string() where once I used pseudo_random_string().  Mostly.
Use filename_from_random_bits() to make into filenames (and so id's).  Maybe in BlockId constructor.
BlockId shouldn't be assignable from string.

Use outer_block& (and maybe shared_ptr<Block>) instead of Block*  (pimpl).

Remove Stage.  Implement TransportFS.  Later TransportNetwork (simple block server).
